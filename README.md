# MPIN-Strength-Analyzer

# üîé Overview
Mobile Personal Identification Numbers (MPINs) are used as secure login credentials for accessing mobile banking applications. However, users often select MPINs that are easy to guess ‚Äî making their accounts vulnerable to attacks.

## üîê Why MPINs Are Often Weak:
Use of commonly repeated or popular patterns (e.g., 1122, 0000, 2580)

MPINs derived from personal demographic information, such as:

üìÖ Date of Birth (DOB)

üíç Wedding Anniversary

üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Spouse‚Äôs Date of Birth

For instance, if a user's DOB is 15-Aug-1995, possible weak MPINs might include:

1508 (Day + Month)

9508 (Year + Month)

1595 (Day + Year)

These patterns are easily predictable ‚Äî especially when attackers use social engineering or data breaches to guess them.

# Challenge Statement and Implementation Parts

### Part A: Detection of Common 4-Digit MPINs

- Develop a function that evaluates whether a 4-digit MPIN is present in a predefined list of commonly used or easily guessable PINs.
- If the input MPIN matches any entry in the list, classify it as **WEAK**.
- This part should not consider any demographic data such as birthdates or anniversaries ‚Äî the analysis is based solely on pattern repetition and popularity.


### Part B: MPIN Strength Evaluation Using Demographic Data (4-digit MPIN)

- Enhance the MPIN checker to accept additional user demographic inputs:
  - Date of Birth (DOB)
  - Wedding Anniversary
  - Spouse's Date of Birth
- The program should analyze whether the entered 4-digit MPIN corresponds to any recognizable patterns derived from these personal dates.
- Output the MPIN strength as **WEAK** or **STRONG**.


### Part C: MPIN Strength Analysis with Detailed Weakness Reasons (4-digit MPIN)
- Extend the program to output not just the MPIN strength, but also the specific reasons if the MPIN is identified as WEAK.
- The output should include:
  - Strength: **WEAK** or **STRONG**
  - If weak then the reason why was it considered weak: It should give from the following the reasons as an array:
     - `COMMONLY_USED`
     - `DEMOGRAPHIC_DOB_SELF`
     - `DEMOGRAPHIC_DOB_SPOUSE`
     - `DEMOGRAPHIC_ANNIVERSARY`
  - If the MPIN is considered STRONG, the reasons array must be empty.

  
### Part D: Extended Support for 6-Digit MPINs
- Enhance the system to support validation for both 4-digit and 6-digit MPINs.
- All checks from previous parts ‚Äî including common pattern detection and demographic-based combinations ‚Äî should be adapted accordingly for 6-digit inputs.

# üîß Implementation Overview
The project is implemented using Python, organized into modular functions, and can be run via a Jupyter Notebook or a Streamlit web app. The core logic resides in the file mpin_strength_analyzer_shubham_gusain.py.

### Key components of the implementation include:
  - A predefined list of commonly used MPINs for both 4-digit and 6-digit formats.
  - Utility functions to generate date-based combinations from demographic inputs such as:
     - `Day, Month, Year`
     - `Reversed year`
     - `All meaningful 4- and 6-digit patterns`
     - `Reversed Year`
   - A main evaluator function that checks:
      - If the MPIN is commonly used
      - If it matches any demographic-based pattern
      - Returns both strength (WEAK/STRONG) and reasons
  -A comprehensive test suite with 40+ test cases to verify all conditions across Part A‚ÄìD.
  -A user-friendly Streamlit interface for input and live testing.
