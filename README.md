# MPIN-Strength-Analyzer

# 🔎 Overview
Mobile Personal Identification Numbers (MPINs) are used as secure login credentials for accessing mobile banking applications. However, users often select MPINs that are easy to guess — making their accounts vulnerable to attacks.

## 🔐 Why MPINs Are Often Weak:
Use of commonly repeated or popular patterns (e.g., 1122, 0000, 2580)

MPINs derived from personal demographic information, such as:

📅 Date of Birth (DOB)

💍 Wedding Anniversary

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Spouse’s Date of Birth

For instance, if a user's DOB is 02-Jan-1998, possible weak MPINs might include:

0201 (Day + Month)

9802 (Year + Month)

0198 (Day + Year)

These patterns are easily predictable — especially when attackers use social engineering or data breaches to guess them.
